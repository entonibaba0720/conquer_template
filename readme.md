This was an old project (2018) and now I see the errors in the layout, but this is a part of my coding journey and I don't mind it. :) 

# Conquer template  

This is the perfect project for beginners.
You can use HTML, CSS, Javascript and make a similar website like this.
This is a really great starting place for new learners. They have the opportunity to build something they can feel proud of while still being challenged. The Conquer template utilizes Bootstrap, but it is important to avoid using this to build the project.

## Original template
I find this project on Medium. (https://medium.com/@GarrettLevine/5-projects-to-complete-when-starting-to-learn-front-end-web-development-48e8a1ce3178)
I didn't focus on the exact copying, I made minor changes in some places, but I think it's pretty much the same.
